# Activity_recognition#  Sport Activity Recognition and Correction

A machine learning project designed to recognize and correct sport activities in real time using pose estimation from videos. This project is part of a PCD (Projet de Conception et Développement) academic requirement.

##  Project Objectives

- Recognize 4 common sport activities using AI:
  - Barbell Biceps Curl
  - Push-Up
  - Shoulder Press
  - Squat
- Analyze movement correctness based on keypoint sequences.
- Provide real-time feedback for exercise correction.

##  Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **MediaPipe** – Pose Estimation
- **OpenCV** – Video Processing
- **TensorFlow (CNN + LSTM)** – Sequence Modeling
- **Google Colab** (for training), **VS Code** (for local development)
